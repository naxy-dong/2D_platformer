# 2D_platformer
This is my version of 2d_platformer using libraries Processing and p5.js.
## P5 version:
You can run the project using a live server (required by the p5 library) OR using this [link](https://editor.p5js.org/ydong001/sketches/J3va7MgrW).
## JavaScript version:
This is a project/tutorial using pure JavaScript without a library.
## Processing:
This is my most polished version of the project. Working on a game with Processing is not as easy as the other libraries/game engines. For example, the Processing library do not have simple method that flips the sprite images. I had to implement the method that manipulate the matrix to flip every pixel of the image.
